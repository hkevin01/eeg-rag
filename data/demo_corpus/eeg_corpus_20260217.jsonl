This research examines the utility of quantitative EEG measures as biomarkers for brain health. Methods: We recorded from 10 participants during rest and multiple task conditions, including memory tasks, attention tasks, and motor tasks. High-density EEG with 64 channels was used to capture spatial patterns of brain activity. Signal processing included artifact removal, frequency decomposition, and connectivity analysis. Results: Significant differences in alpha asymmetry were observed between groups, particularly in frontal and parietal regions. Beta oscillations showed task-specific modulation during motor preparation and execution. Gamma band activity correlated with attention performance.
