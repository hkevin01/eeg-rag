This research examines the utility of quantitative EEG measures as biomarkers for brain health. Methods: We recorded from 10 participants during rest and multiple task conditions, including memory tasks, attention tasks, and motor tasks. High-density EEG with 64 channels was used to capture spatial patterns of brain activity. Signal processing included artifact removal, frequency decomposition, and connectivity analysis. Results: Significant differences in alpha asymmetry were observed between groups, particularly in frontal and parietal regions. Beta oscillations showed task-specific modulation during motor preparation and execution. Gamma band activity correlated with attention performance. Conclusion: These EEG markers show promise for diagnosis and monitoring of brain function in clinical settings.", "authors": ["Davis C", "Smith A"], "journal": "Epilepsia", "year": 2020, "doi": "10.1234/mock.0", "keywords": ["sleep", "neural oscillations", "epilepsy", "machine learning", "seizure detection", "theta waves"], "mesh_terms": ["Brain Waves", "Biomarkers", "Epilepsy", "Neural Networks"]}

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique that measures electrical activity in the brain. Methods: We recorded continuous EEG from participants during both resting state and active task conditions, analyzing frequency bands from delta to gamma. We found significant correlations between theta power in frontal regions and cognitive performance measures. Results: Statistical analysis revealed distinct patterns of neural oscillations associated with different cognitive states. These findings suggest potential biomarkers for clinical applications in diagnosis and monitoring of neurological conditions.
